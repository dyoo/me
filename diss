Thesis statement:

 Programming environments can effectively run on the Web and interact
 with Web-based resources, while overcoming the difficulties imposed
 by the dominant Web programming platforms.

The document:

- introduces the concept of a Web-based programming environment
- discusses design choices
- describes why we picked ours (tried two ways!)
- talks about the current, working system and its use
- explains that once something runs on the Web, there are now new
 opportunities/demands for it:
 -- client-side Web computation (mashups, etc.)
 -- server-side Web computation
 -- running the Web on new platforms (eg, phones)
- extensions to world/universe to handle these platforms
 -- need a notion of effects
 -- need to design Web world
 -- need to make Web and Ajax integrate [not yet done]
- handles the difficulties of the operating environment
 -- nesting things in JavaScript is dangerous; so how to obtain
    nested big-bang?
 -- need enough performance [not yet done]
