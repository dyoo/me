Thesis statement:

 Programming environments can effectively run on the Web and interact
 with Web-based resources, while overcoming the difficulties imposed
 by the dominant Web programming platforms.

The document:

- introduces the concept of a Web-based programming environment
- discusses design choices
- describes why we picked ours (tried two ways!)
- talks about the current, working system and its use
- explains that once something runs on the Web, there are now new
 opportunities/demands for it:
 -- client-side Web computation (mashups, etc.)
 -- server-side Web computation
 -- running the Web on new platforms (eg, phones)
- extensions to world/universe to handle these platforms
 -- need a notion of effects
 -- need to design Web world
 -- need to make Web and Ajax integrate [not yet done]
- handles the difficulties of the operating environment
 -- nesting things in JavaScript is dangerous; so how to obtain
    nested big-bang?
 -- need enough performance [not yet done]

From Kathi:

I've gotten confirmation that the dept has no particular standard for
a dissertation proposal in terms of format or length.  So, you can use
your MS thesis proposal as a template, but it will probably be a bit
longer (I estimate between 5 and 10 pages when you are done).

In particular, the document must:

- Clearly explain and motivate the problem you are solving, including
what is hard and interesting about it

- Outline the technical approach that you will take in enough detail
for the committee to believe that it addresses the problem
appropriately and adequately.

- Outline the major steps that you think you need to take to solve the
problem (to help the committee determine that the project is both
large and small enough to make for a good dissertation).

- Describe how you will evaluate your work

- Cover related work sufficiently to demonstrate that your topic is
indeed an unsolved problem
