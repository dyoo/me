Moby: Manage subprojects

    These are subprojects that need attention by someone:

        SMS event handlers: provide an on-sms-receive event hook.
        jsworld2
        js-numbers
        universe
        image library
        3d opengl world

    We need to write tutorial documentation for examples, such as

        hello world
        calculator
        flag designer
        sketchpad
        chasing the mouse
        a mashup

Misc

Double check the output from the web-compiler.  What programs are
people submitting?


Remind Paul Suranyi when wescheme is usable.


Port Dana's frogger game over to wescheme


Address Emmanuel's question about scaling the window.  See "Screen Scaling" thread.

Port Universe.ss over to wescheme.

Attack the issues on the github tracker.  http://github.com/dyoo/moby-scheme/issues/

Pull more of the test suite from PLT Scheme into Moby.

investigate race condition in loading sounds for the bell ringer; Shriram was seeing very bad, nondeterministic behavior when loading resources.


add Moby define-runtime-resource, so we can package local file resources.


add testing support to Moby: add testing harness that works with random



In lullaby:

    In Lullaby, display the title of the song, until you get to the point of playing the whole playlist.

    document playlists.

    fix the playlist-playing feature so it can play multiple songs, and verify that the Lullaby program is robust against pressing play, pause, and stop in rapid succession.

    Add a pause between songs in the silencing music player.

    add explode-playlist and join-playlist forms.

For Baduk Clock:

    Address issues with baduk-clock.ss:  * Sometimes button clicks aren't registering. This seems to be a bug in jsworld. I don't know yet what the root cause is, but I'll put on my TODO to investigate it sometime after the demo. * The app runs a bit slowly on both the iPhone and the G1. I need to profile where the time is going.

    add a button for starting / pausing the baduk clock, and really make it an application by putting it on the respective Google and Apple App Stores.


Add title to the generated index.html in Moby so that programs are properly named when loaded from a web browser.

change Rolling out of Time to use css attributes to control motion.

add 'choose contact' to the phonegap list of features.

fill in prose content for the bottom links of the WeScheme splash screen.  Also add an explanatory phrase to the splash.  Link up interesting examples from the about page, such as:

test how-to-design program solutions on WeScheme: make sure it works without errors!http://www.htdp.org/servlets/passwords.scm

when logged in, opening a new file should automatically save it, without prompting from the user.

look at widgetpad http://widgetpad.com/; compare and contrast against WeScheme.

write bulk source downloader/uploader synchronization for wescheme.

make the share dialog accessible from the console

modify semantics of share so you can share programs that can't be run.

add admin interface to regenerate compiled programs, and do bulk load/restore of programs

add bug submission link to wescheme interface
